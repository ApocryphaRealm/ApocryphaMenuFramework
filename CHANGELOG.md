# ApocryphaMenuFramework - changelog

Written as changes happen, not reconstructed afterwards (rule 61). Each version carries its
**version-ledger status**, so this file cannot quietly claim more than the ledger does:

* **working** - observed running in game
* **untested** - built and packaged, not yet confirmed
* **failed** - built but crashed or malfunctioned; the number was reclaimed
* **scratch** - a hypothesis-test build that never held a real number

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-27 - untested

### Added
- M0 scaffold: original framework (not an SMF fork - licence rails in plan.md), CommonLibSSE-NG dual-runtime plugin skeleton, public C API with SMF_GetReservedKeyCodes as the first export, theme constants (true black / #F5F2E9 / borders everywhere) and the in-game-proven fHUDOpacity resolver ported from DEM. Rendering, input and the page registry are M1-M3.
