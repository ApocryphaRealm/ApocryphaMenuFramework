// Replacement ARTWORK for the framework's menu shell, so a UI author can make Apocrypha Menu
// Framework match their own interface instead of accepting the built-in look.
//
// Requested 2026-09-09 for borokoshow, to match Dragonborn UI. It is the standing project meaning
// of "theme": a theme is REPLACEMENT ART, not a colour tint over the same shapes.
//
// WHAT AN AUTHOR SHIPS
//   Frame       one square PNG, 32-bit RGBA, TRANSPARENT CENTRE, drawn as a nine-slice.
//               192x192 with 64px corners is the suggested default; the corner is an INI key
//               because only the artist knows where their ornament stops.
//   Background  either a small tileable PNG or a full-screen one. Which it is is decided by its
//               own size rather than a fifth INI key: <= kTileThreshold px on both sides tiles,
//               anything larger is stretched to the window. A 256x256 tile and a 1920x1080
//               backdrop therefore both just work.
//   Plates      optional small RGBA PNGs restyling individual controls, found by fixed name
//               inside one folder: toggle.png, slider.png, tab.png.
//
// ALL PNG, NO DDS. AMF decodes through DirectXTK's WIC loader, which handles PNG (and JPG/BMP/
// TIFF) and does not handle DDS at all. Handing it a .dds silently fails to decode, so the
// loader below says so in the log rather than leaving an author guessing.
//
// Every piece is optional and independent: supply only a frame and the rest of the look is
// unchanged. Nothing here can make the menu unusable - a texture that fails to load is skipped
// and the built-in art draws instead.

	// THE ART LIBRARY (2.1.6, the owner, 2026-10-08: "add an assets folder with sub folders for the customization section

	// (ArtKinds.h), a PNG in Data/SKSE/Plugins/ApocryphaMenuFramework/assets/<folder>/<name>.png, named after the theme it
	// came from. Beside it, all optional:
	//   <name>.ini        how it is cut: [Frame] uCorner, uDrawCorner, bTileEdges, sHighlight (frames); uCorner for any
	//                     nine-sliced part; uHotX / uHotY for a cursor
	//   <name>-edge.png   a second layer drawn over the first in the theme's line colour (boxes, buttons, tabs, tick
	//                     boxes, slider grabs, scroll bars): the first layer is tinted with the colour the control has
	//                     right now (at rest, under the mouse, held), so a part keeps the theme's colours and states
	//   <name>-mark.png   the tick, for a tick box
	//   <name>-track.png  the track (and <name>-track-edge.png), for a scroll bar
	// A theme names its parts (s<Kind>Art); the player can pick any part for any theme on Appearance > Art.
